# Canteen-Management 
This project was done to demonstrate and explore the basics and the nuances of object oriented programming. Coded completely in C++, this system used MySQL database as the backend, instead of the conventional file system, to improve scalability.

To build the program : The MySQL Libraries can be downloaded from the folder 'msqllibraries' and these must be installed in the computer and linked to the compiler. Follow [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v_lA1Gg1Q4) tutorial for guidance.

A sample mysql database has also been provided, as the columns' names are hardcoded in the program.

This program can help you understand the various principles and advanced concepts of OOPS in an easy way.

The code is well-documented, so there should be no problem in understanding the code.
